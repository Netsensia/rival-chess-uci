The Rival chess UCI engine C++ source code

Written around 2005/6, this is the headless C++ Rival Chess engine.

UCI-compatible for plugging into any UCI-compliant GUI which allows for easy match-ups against other engines.

All GUI-related code and Borland-specific dependencies were removed.  Developed using Visual Studio.
